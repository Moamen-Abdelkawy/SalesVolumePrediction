### SalesVolumePrediction

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting sales volume using various regression models. The project explores multiple advanced machine learning techniques, including traditional ensemble methods and deep learning models, to accurately forecast sales volume based on historical data.

#### Key Features:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline, including handling of numerical and categorical variables, scaling, and one-hot encoding.

- **Model Selection**: Implementation and evaluation of multiple models, including:
  - **Random Forest Regressor** - An ensemble model known for its robustness and interpretability.
  - **Enhanced Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** - A deep neural network optimized with dropout layers for improved generalization.
  - **Deep Cross Network (DCN)** - A model combining cross-layer and deep-layer architecture for effective feature interaction.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search and cross-validation techniques applied to optimize model performance.

- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE to compare model accuracy and robustness on the test dataset.

- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Examination of feature importance for interpretability, with visualizations to highlight influential features across models.

- **Visualizations**: Training and validation loss curves, feature importance plots, and comparative performance bar charts to provide clear insights into model behavior and performance.

#### Objectives:
The goal of this project is to develop a robust predictive model that accurately forecasts sales volume, which can be used by businesses to make informed inventory and sales strategy decisions. By exploring different modeling approaches and evaluating them on key metrics, this project aims to identify the most effective model for the task.

#### Use Case:
This repository is intended for data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and business analysts interested in sales forecasting using machine learning. The code is modular and can be adapted to similar prediction tasks involving structured, tabular data.
